# LaunchEngine
> Note: <br/>
> LaunchEngine is a working project I use for game engine development. It is very much in progress, and is here to show that I can in fact write C++ outside of the context of Unreal Engine.

> This engine will be recoded from scratch soon, as most of it is code stubs and placeholders for more complete functionality later, and now that school is out I should finally have time to work on it.

#### The Graphics branch of this engine is the most up to date branch as of 06/20/22 and is one of my first attempts into writing an OpenGL graphics engine.

For a glance at what's been happening, head to [Launch/src/Launch/Graphics/OpenGl.cpp](./Launch/src/Launch/Graphics/OpenGl.cpp)
